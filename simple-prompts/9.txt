Write a gate that takes a string (`tape`) and returns the total count of vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`) in that string as an atom (`@ud`). Assume only lowercase letters.

Example inputs and outputs:
Input: "hello" : Output: 2 (the vowels are `e` and `o`)
Input: "sky" : Output: 0
Input: "education" : Output: 5
