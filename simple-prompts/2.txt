Write a gate that takes a string (`tape`) containing multiple words separated by spaces and returns the longest word as a new string (`tape`). If there are multiple words with the same maximum length, return the first one encountered.

Example inputs and outputs:
Input: "hello world" : Output: "hello"
Input: "find the longestword in this string" : Output: "longestword"
Input: "a bb ccc ddd" : Output: "ccc"
