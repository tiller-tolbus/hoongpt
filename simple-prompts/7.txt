Write a gate that takes a natural number (type `@ud`) as input, calculates the sum of its decimal digits, and returns that sum as a natural number (type `@ud`).

Example inputs and outputs:
Input: 123 : Output: 6 (because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6)
Input: 4096 : Output: 19 (4 + 0 + 9 + 6 = 19)
Input: 0 : Output: 0
